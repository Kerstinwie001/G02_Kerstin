## Pre-Processing 
at the beginning all subjects with low quality of data where excluded, in the initial data set and in the replication data set. 
## Validation-Test 
To test the validation of the data, the Testosteron Levels between the two sex groups where analysied, with the expaction of a higher "Mean"-Score of Testosteron Level in the male group. Therefore, this effect should also be visible in the replication data.
## Reliability
to test the relaibility, the correlation between a repeated measurment (SD = short delay, after 10 min & LD = long delay – after 1 day) where tested via paired t-test in the initial and replication data.
## Aggrigation 
Since the SD and LD memory performance are highly correlated,we calculated also the average memory performance for the downstream analysis for both samples.
## Validation fMRI
the fMRI signal between negative and neutral Pictures where compared in both data-sets.

##Hypothesis 
We hypothsis, that there is a higher activation of the Amygdala when presented the negative Pictures than the neutral Pictures in both dataset. Therefor, fisher t-test where used.

Form initial 1000 subjects the data from 833 subjects were used for the data Analysis of the initial dataset and 253 out of 300 from the replication data set.
## Validation 
to validate the data, the "Mean"-Score of Testosteron where expacted higher in the male group. The mean-score in Group 1 ist 1.21 and in group 2 23.191. Thats why the male group should be group 2, in the initial data set. This findings could be replicated in the replication data with a "Mean" of 1.21 in group 1 and 24.167 in group 2. 
## Reliability
In the initial Data, the correlation between a repeated measurment (SD = short delay, after 10 min & LD = long delay – after 1 day) where 0.8569, with and significant p-value < 2.2e-16. In the replication group the correlation is 0.868 with a significant p-value of < 2.2e-16. 
## Validation fMRI
the fMRI signal between negative and neutral Pictures where compared in both data-sets,with an correlation of 0.748 in the initical data set and and an correlation of 0.766 in the replication data set.
