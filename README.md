##Pre-Processing 
at the beginning all subjects with low quality of data where excluded, in the initial data set and in the replication data set. 
##Validation-Test 
To test the validation of the data, the Testosteron Levels between the two sex groups where analysied, with the expaction of a higher "Mean"-Score of Testosteron Level in the male group. Therefore, this effect should also be visible in the replication data.
##Reliability
to test the relaibility, the correlation between a repeated measurment (SD = short delay, after 10 min & LD = long delay â€“ after 1 day) where tested via paired t-test in the initial and replication data.
#Results 
##Pre-Proccessing 
Form initial 1000 subjects the data from 833 subjects were used for the data Analysis of the initial dataset and 253 out of 300 from the replication data set.
##Validation 
to validate the data, the "Mean"-Score of Testosteron where expacted higher in the male group. The mean-score in Group 1 ist 1.21 and in group 2 23.191. Thats why the male group should be group 2, in the initial data set. This findings could be replicated in the replication data with a "Mean" of 1.21 in group 1 and 24.167 in group 2.
